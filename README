CycleMix

This is an R package which assigns single cell RNASeq data to cell-cycle stages using annotated marker genes. Various sets of marker genes used in the literature are provided or users can provide their own, both positive and negative markers are supported. 

Each stage is assigned independently using a gaussian mixture-model and cells can be assigned to one, multiple or no cell-cycle stage.
