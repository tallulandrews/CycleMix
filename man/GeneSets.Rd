\format{A list of dataframes each with three columns: Gene, Stage, Dir
Genes are provided as HGNC gene symbols
Stage is which cell-cycle stage the gene is differentially expressed in
Dir is the direction of differential expression : 1=upregulated, -1=downregulated
Note: Genes may be differentially expressed in more than one stage and may appear in multiple dataframes

\description{
HGeneSets includes:

	Whitfield original cell-cycle genes from Whitfield et al. 2002

	Tirosh modification of Whitfield lists used in Tirosh et al. 2016

	Macosko modification of Whitfield lists used in Macosko et al. 2015

	Quiesc combination of G0 genes from Reactome, and quiescence markers from Cheung et al. 2013

	Seurat originates from v4 of the Seurat package.

MGeneSets includes:

	Cyclone all genes used by the pre-computed mouse classifier in cyclone (Scialdone et al. 2015). Each gene was 
assigned to the stage and direction for which it exhibited the largest fold-change relative to
the overall mean in our example data.
